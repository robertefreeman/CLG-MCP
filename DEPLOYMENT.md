# CLG-MCP Deployment Guide

This comprehensive guide covers deploying the CLG-MCP server to Cloudflare Workers. For general information about the project, see [`README.md`](README.md). For authentication setup, see [`AUTHENTICATION.md`](AUTHENTICATION.md).

## Quick Deployment Checklist

### âœ… Prerequisites
- [ ] Node.js 20+ installed (required by Wrangler CLI)
- [ ] Cloudflare account created (free tier)
- [ ] Wrangler CLI installed: `npm install -g wrangler`

**Note**: Wrangler requires Node.js v20.0.0 or higher. Check your version: `node --version`

### âœ… Repository Setup
- [ ] Repository cloned locally
- [ ] Dependencies installed: `npm run setup`
- [ ] Project builds successfully: `npm run build`

### âœ… Cloudflare Authentication
- [ ] Authenticated with Cloudflare: `wrangler login`
- [ ] Account ID identified (found in Cloudflare dashboard)
- [ ] Subdomain noted (your-subdomain.workers.dev)

### âœ… Deployment Options

#### Option A: Automated Deployment (Recommended)
- [ ] Run: `npm run deploy:full`
- [ ] Verify deployment: `npm run test:connection`

#### Option B: Manual Deployment
- [ ] Deploy: `npm run deploy`
- [ ] Test: `npm run test:connection`

**Note**: This simplified version does not require KV namespace setup.

### âœ… Post-Deployment
- [ ] Worker URL identified: `https://clg-mcp.your-subdomain.workers.dev`
- [ ] Connection test passes
- [ ] MCP client configured with worker URL
- [ ] Test search functionality

## Detailed Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup

**Before starting, ensure you have Node.js 20.0.0 or higher:**
```bash
# Check your Node.js version
node --version

# Should show v20.0.0 or higher
# If not, update Node.js from https://nodejs.org
```

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd clg-mcp

# Install dependencies and build
npm run setup

# Verify everything compiles
npm run build
```

### 2. Cloudflare Configuration

```bash
# Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Verify authentication
wrangler whoami
```

### 3. Automated Deployment

The automated deployment script handles everything:

```bash
npm run deploy:full
```

This script will:
1. âœ… Validate environment and authentication
2. âœ… Build the project
3. âœ… Deploy to Cloudflare Workers
4. âœ… Verify deployment health

**Note**: The simplified architecture no longer requires KV namespace setup.

### 4. Manual Deployment (Alternative)

If you prefer manual control:

```bash
# Build and deploy
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

The simplified architecture eliminates the need for KV namespace setup, making deployment much easier.

### 5. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Test connection and functionality
npm run test:connection

# Or test with specific URL
npm run test:connection https://clg-mcp.your-subdomain.workers.dev
```

Expected output:
```
ðŸ§ª Starting CLG-MCP connection tests...
ðŸ“¡ Server URL: https://clg-mcp.your-subdomain.workers.dev

âœ… Health Check (150ms)
   Server is healthy (200)
âœ… MCP Handshake (200ms)
   MCP protocol initialized successfully
âœ… Search Tool (300ms)
   Search functionality working
âœ… Categories Browse (250ms)
   Category browsing working
âœ… Rate Limiting (180ms)
   Rate limiting is active

ðŸŽ‰ All tests passed! Your MCP server is ready to use.
```

## Environment-Specific Deployments

### Development Environment

```bash
# Deploy to development environment
npm run deploy:dev

# This creates a separate worker: clg-mcp-dev
# Useful for testing before production deployment
```

### Production Environment

```bash
# Deploy to production (default)
npm run deploy:full

# Or manually
wrangler deploy --env production
```

## Finding Your Worker URL

After successful deployment, your worker will be available at:

```
https://WORKER_NAME.YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.workers.dev
```

Where:
- **WORKER_NAME**: `clg-mcp` (from wrangler.toml)
- **YOUR_SUBDOMAIN**: Your Cloudflare subdomain

### Finding Your Subdomain

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Click on "Workers & Pages"
3. Your subdomain is shown in the format: `your-subdomain.workers.dev`

## Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### Authentication Problems

```bash
# Problem: "Error: Not authenticated"
# Solution: Login to Cloudflare
wrangler login

# Problem: "Error: No account found"
# Solution: Check account association
wrangler whoami
```

### Configuration Issues

```bash
# Problem: "Error: Invalid configuration"
# Solution: Check wrangler.toml format
npm run lint
npm run build

# Verify environment variables
npm run test:connection
```

### Build Failures

```bash
# Problem: TypeScript compilation errors
# Solution: Fix code issues
npm run lint
npm run build

# Problem: Missing dependencies
# Solution: Reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Deployment Failures

```bash
# Problem: "Error: Script too large"
# Solution: The built script exceeds 1MB limit
# Check for large dependencies or excessive code

# Problem: "Error: CPU time limit exceeded"
# Solution: Optimize code for faster execution
# Current limit: 10ms per request
```

### Connection Issues

```bash
# Problem: Connection timeouts
# Solution: Verify worker is deployed and healthy
wrangler tail  # View real-time logs
npm run test:connection

# Problem: CORS errors
# Solution: Worker handles CORS automatically
# Check if request headers are correct
```

## Monitoring Your Deployment

### Real-time Logs

```bash
# View live logs from your worker
wrangler tail

# View logs for specific environment
wrangler tail --env production
```

### Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Go to [Cloudflare Workers Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com)
2. Click on your worker name
3. Monitor:
   - Request volume
   - Error rates
   - Response times
   - CPU usage

### Usage Analytics

The free tier includes:
- Request analytics
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- Geographic distribution

## Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

1. Add your domain to Cloudflare
2. Go to Workers & Pages â†’ Custom Domains
3. Add custom domain route
4. Update MCP client configuration with new URL

## Security Considerations

- Worker runs in Cloudflare's secure sandbox
- No sensitive data stored in environment variables
- Rate limiting prevents abuse
- CORS headers configured appropriately

## Scaling Considerations

### Free Tier Limits
- 100,000 requests/day
- 10ms CPU time per request
- 10 Workers per account

### Optimization Tips
- Minimize external API calls
- Use efficient data structures
- Implement smart retry logic
- Utilize built-in delays for respectful scraping

## Backup and Recovery

### Configuration Backup
```bash
# Backup wrangler.toml
cp wrangler.toml wrangler.toml.backup

# Backup source code
git commit -am "Backup before deployment"
```

### Disaster Recovery
```bash
# Redeploy from clean state
npm run build
npm run deploy

# Restore from backup
git checkout HEAD~1 -- wrangler.toml
```

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. **Configure MCP Client**: Add worker URL to your MCP client (see [`README.md`](README.md) for client configurations)
2. **Test Functionality**: Use [`scripts/test-connection.ts`](scripts/test-connection.ts) to verify all tools work
3. **Set Up Authentication**: Configure authentication tokens if needed (see [`AUTHENTICATION.md`](AUTHENTICATION.md))
4. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of free tier limits in Cloudflare dashboard
5. **Set Up Alerts**: Configure notifications for errors
6. **Plan Scaling**: Consider paid tier if usage grows beyond free limits
